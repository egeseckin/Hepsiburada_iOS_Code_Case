Hepsiburada iTunes Code Case

I builded an iTunes search app by applying MVC structure. Api is fetching with the help of Alamofire package.

How to run:
- Download the project from main branch 
- After indexing finished on xcode click on the no scheme at the top and click on new scheme, press OK
- After creating scheme, click on the any ios phone to run (ex. iPhone 12) then run it

About the app:

- When user starts to type it will automatically starting to search based on the category user selected.
- It will start searching if user enters more than 2 character
- Multiple words with spaces can be entered
- After results appeared, any result can be selected to get more detail about it
